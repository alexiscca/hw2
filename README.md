Homework #2


In this homework assignment I learned how to make objects move. I learned how to replicate a mondrian painting and make it's compoments change. I also learned how to make a ball bounce back and forth on the screen. 


 In your README.me file, answer: what changes in the animation when you renamed the variables? What if you change them to nonsense names, like "dog" and "cat"?
 
 > Nothing changed because the name of the variable is completely up to the programmer and it does not affect the execution of the script.  You can use any nonsense name, but it would be hard to understand what the script is doing.
